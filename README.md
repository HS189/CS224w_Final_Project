# CS224w_Final_Project

Run `python3 btc_training.py` in CARE-GNN folder. Default params should currently be good, make sure torch manual seed is at 2 and run for 250 epochs to get 0.62 F1. Not sure if torch manual seed will be enough to repro on colab but at least we'll be able to say what results we got locally.
